## Craft

I am considered a technical leader on my team. I autonomously engage with product and system owners across Dropbox to help create, build, and innovate security defenses. I have an in-depth knowledge of Security and possess a comprehensive view of how the Dropbox environment and services fit together. I focus on large and ambiguous security problems across internal and partner organizations. I take a long-term view and understand the details about my team’s security services and processes. I drive and plan the Security of large, complex, cross-team projects/incidents that could span multiple quarters and often involve numerous security members. I mentor, teach, and influence other members of Security continuously - the scope of my impact is amplified through their successes. My understanding of the business context and organization priorities enables me to deliver in alignment with longer-term security needs, not just immediate requirements.

**Responsibility**: Security Execution  
**Key Behaviors**
	
- My work demonstrates significant domain expertise in three or more security domains and secondary specializations, (e.g. infrastructure security, application security, threat intelligence, security operations, incident response, endpoint security, or identity management).  I understand the latest defensive capabilities provided by each layer of the stack in my purview and understand when to deploy them.
- I have extensive experience with multiple methods of assessment, and can make the right call to identify the best approach for a given problem.
- I design and/or implement structural changes to enforce security requirements and defenses at the scope of an entire product/codebase (e.g. Paper, Hellosign, or rSERVER)
- I define and implement a comprehensive strategy to address a security problem, drawing upon a mixture of the necessary first-party, open source, or off-the-shelf technologies to enforce security requirements, detect badness, or defend Dropbox.
- I consistently identify and provide solutions for non-obvious issues in the design, implementation, operation, and evaluation of security processes and technologies.
- I own the response to complex security incidents, or drive strategic remediation initiatives which involve many teams/organizations/systems across Dropbox.
- I track incidents, vulnerabilities, and other security trends over time and effectively incorporate lessons learned into Security strategy and requirements.
- I effectively partner across the company to define and implement security requirements within a scope spanning several different layers of an infrastructure stack, disparate teams across several organizations, or parallel workstreams of a large scale initiative. 

**Responsibility**: Technology Fluency  
**Key Behaviors**

- I apply a comprehensive understanding of the Dropbox technology stack and relevant external technologies within my focus. I both maintain awareness and ensure my organization is aware of changes as they occur.I influence the design and architecture choices made by partner-orgs (e.g., system, network, or software).
- I understand that technology, threats, and responses evolve and use that evolution to identify opportunities to improve security controls accordingly.

**Responsibility**: Threat Fluency  
**Key Behaviors**

- I have a deep understanding of attacker tools, techniques, and processes (TTPs) and the standard defenses/mitigations for them.
- I am broadly aware of the kinds of defenses and their efficacy at mitigating attacks relevant to Dropbox Security.
- I am continuously tracking and learning about attacks/attackers both inside and outside of my focus area
- I am familiar with historical attacks of consequence and the lessons learned from them.
