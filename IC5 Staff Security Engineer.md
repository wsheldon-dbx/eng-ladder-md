# IC5 Staff Security Engineer

I set a multi-year, multi-team risk reduction strategy and deliver it through direct implementation, broad cross-organizational technical leadership, or strategic guidance. I involve myself in initiatives across the company and ensure cross-functional alignment and amplify the impact of distinct initiatives.

## Scope
Area of ownership and level of autonomy / ambiguity

- I deliver multi-year, multi-team security goals.
- I work in areas where the security strategy is not defined. I may not know the security problem before starting.
- I own complex issues, and decompose them into simple, scalable solutions and work products. I am able to explain and teach this skill.
- I exhibit a very high standard of technical judgement, innovation and execution to tackle open-ended problems that require difficult prioritization, defining both the what and how of things to be done.

## Collaborative Reach
Organizational reach and extent of influence

- I exercise judgment that favors the priorities of the wider security org rather than favoring locally optimal outcomes.
- I Influence the business and technology direction. I align teams and orgs towards simple, coherent security goals.
  
## Impact Levers
Technical levers typically exercised to achieve business impact

- I demonstrate a high level of depth in a particular platform or product category that brings unique business value. 
- I excel at defining the vision for and delivering large business-impacting projects with multiple constraints.
- I increasingly influence product decisions/scope and determine the right technical tradeoffs to deliver customer value quickly.
- I lead by example, I serve as a role model for other Dropbox security engineers, and teach all aspects of Security Craft.
- I deliver with complete independence.
- I work on significantly large or endemic security problems and projects.
- I adapt to fill both technical and organizational gaps across the security organization, sometimes assuming roles that are not clearly scoped as Security Engineering or IC.
- I use my expertise to affect system security and how the organization operates, partnering with TLs and leads to drive the organization towards higher degrees of maturity, effectiveness, and excellence.

I identify endemic security problems, define technologies, and architectures to mitigate them. I set the standard for excellence in the security organization and mitigate security risks and threats with innovative concepts.

- I independently and proactively identify areas of security risk and future needs, reach out to the relevant teams, collaboratively design solutions to that risk, and successfully implement them in a sustainable way that “permanently” reduces risk across entire classes of threats.
- I design, deliver, and drive solutions for significantly complex security and risk problems across dropbox organizations.
- I split my time in different areas such as, security solution design, and/or security architecture, based on where my skills have the greatest impact (or in response to a security problem).
- I deliver solutions that are resistant to erosion of security controls over time and integrate ongoing testing strategies as part of the foundational design
- I own the response to extraordinary or otherwise sensitive security incidents.
- I adapt my role to the needs of an initiative, the security team, or a cross-functional partner team over time.
- I understand that technology, threats, and responses evolve, and drive that evolution to create opportunity to improve security across Dropbox.
- I motivate security controls that simplify, optimize, and prevent bottlenecks.
